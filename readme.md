## Preliminary Requirements

Hi Anup,

Here are updated instructions for the required work.

# Installation requirements
* Git for Windows
* Composer (dependency manager)

You should be able to run both `git` and `composer` from the command line and
see output about the commands.

# Working with our code
* From the command line, go to an appropriate directory and run:
  `git clone git@github.com:revolverobotics/api-frontend.git`
* You should see the repo download to your computer.
* When finished downloading, enter the folder and type `git pull origin dev`.
* Next, run `git checkout dev`.
* Now type `composer install`.
* You should see `composer` installing the necessary packages.
* When done, send me a chat and we'll go from here.

thank you,

Tim
